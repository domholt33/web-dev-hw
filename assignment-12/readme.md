#Assignment 12

1. My client was a donut shop owner who wanted a fun and interactive way to advertise their donuts.
2. Display block stacks things one on top of the other. Inline keeps the items in a line without any inherent lines between them and inline block keeps them in line but separated by a margin.
3. I had an enjoyable time playing with the dummy text and unlicensed images to give the page character. I am still battling with the problem of the navigation links coming out backwards from what I intended but I can switch their order to trick the system when I want to.  I ran into a big problem early on when I was trying to place a background. I had a class assigned to the wrong div and it kept changing things I didn't want to change. I can see where organization is key.
