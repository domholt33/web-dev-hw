<P>  A boy was digging at the edge of the garden when he </P>
<P>  saw a big toe. He tried to pick it up, but it was stuck </P>
<P>  to something. So he gave it a good hard jerk, and it </P>
<P>  came off in his hand. Then he heard something groan </P>
<P>  and scamper away. </P>

<P>  The boy took the toe into the kitchen and showed it </P>
<P>  to his mother.<span class="mother"> "It looks nice and plump,"</span> she said.<span class="mother"> "I'll </span></P>
<P> <span class="mother"> put it in the soup, and we'll have it for supper."<span> </P>

<P>  That night his father carved the toe into three pieces. </P>

<P>  and they each had a piece. Then they did the dishes, </P>
<P>  and when it got dark they went to bed.

<P>  The boy fell asleep almost at once. But in the middle </P>
<P>  of the night, a sound awakened him. It was something</P>
<P>  out in the street. It was a voice, and it was calling to </P>
<P>  him.

<P><span class="last">  "Where is my to-o-o-o-o-e?"</span> it groaned.</P>
