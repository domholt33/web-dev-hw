#Assignment 10

1. System fonts are fonts that are available to you on your specific system and are not necessarily transferable to the web because of licensing issues. These are usually meant for printing and not in use during web design. Web fonts are available on specific servers and can be found in places such as google fonts. These are built for use on the web but are not guaranteed to work perfectly. Web-safe fonts are the most reliable as they should be available to all systems that recognize web safe fonts. They will load quicker and increase performance.
2. The reason you want to have fallback fonts is because if someone else system doesn't recognize the font that is used as the primary, a secondary web-safe font will take its place so that the user may still access the information.
3. I was having an issue for a minute with trying to get my read more button to not break up my page flow. I was originally trying to use formatting only with the "a" tag but quickly realized that I should just let it be part of the primary div and then I can use a tag to adjust it further. I had fun practicing with the span function to change the color and font of specific parts of the text.
