2. I was surprised to find how simple it was to ebbed music or a video into your web page. There are so many possibilities with how to style fonts and position content in a web page once you figure out how each element will affect your page.
3. Thank you again for this opportunity. I do believe that one day I will make a website for my company. Whether I do it myself or I have someone else do it, I will understand how I want it to look and what it takes to get there.
