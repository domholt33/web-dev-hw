#Assignment 5
1. There can only be one main document head and one body. The head contains information that determines the page style, code, and the tags which are used to find the page. it also contains the main title of the page and the author. The Body contains everything that will appear on the actual page.
2. Structural markup determines the structure of the page. This includes things like headings and heading size, paragraphs, and page breaks. Semantic markup is elements such as bold and italicized words.
3. I had a pretty good time understanding this assignment. I felt that I missed some of the understanding of the "meta" aspect of the head. I will have to read more about it and I am hoping that I will be able to take this information and paste it into my nest project. I am also curious If I completed the address aspect of my project correctly. Should I have included the email inside of the address code? Something that I felt helped me work faster was with the list items I typed all of them out first and then went through and pasted the li and /li at the beginning and ends of the items.
