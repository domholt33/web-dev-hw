#assignment 9

1. A universal selector type applies the styling elements to the entire page such as fonts and background color. you would use this if you wanted the entire page to look the same unless otherwise specified. An element selector lets you take all of the headings on your page and make them look the same way. you would use this If you wanted the headings to look different from the rest of your text. Class allows you to style your divs in a specific way. You would use this to change the color or content of a specific section different from the page background. Ids allow you to change details such as color of a div without changing how the rest of the divs are styled.
2. I chose a color palette that I found from a 70s themed picture. The color names were not available so I named them myself and I chose
blue-#83B799
purple-#85496F
orange-#F1956E
yellow-#f9d46c
dark purple-#48283D
3. For this assignment I took most of my information from the walkthrough and then made subtle tweaks to it. Having the example of the apple advertisement was also extremely helpful. I figured out how to position my images where I wanted them to be without having them in a specific div or text alignment. One issue that I ran into was figuring out how to set an image or element behind another. I ended up having to reference the book to learn about zindex to set the importance.
