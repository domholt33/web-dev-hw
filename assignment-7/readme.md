#Assignment 7

1. A div is an block of area on your webpage in which you can contain specific sections of your content.
You can have multiple Spans within each div which allows you to put multiple different blocks of content within one div. An id gives each div a name and tells you what type of media or element will be contained within the div. Classes are what is used to determine the style and format of the div and the information contained within.
2. Alt text describes an image so that screen readers can better understand how to describe the image for those who are visually impaired.
3. I ran into problems in this assignment with the YouTube video not wanting to completely show on my web page. It shows that there is a video element but it only allows me to click a link to watch it on YouTube itself. I also, for a moment, had an issue with downloading the mart files in a way where they would play. I got error codes such as source does not exist.
