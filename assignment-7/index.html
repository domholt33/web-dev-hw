  <h2>Lyrics</h2>
<p>Woah, woah</p>
<p>Yeah</p>
  <br>
      <p>Sometimes we laugh and sometimes we cry, but I guess you know now, baby</p>
  <p>  I took a half and she took the whole thing, slow down, baby (baby)</p>
  <p>  We took a trip, now we on your block and it's like a ghost town, baby</p>
  <p>  Where do these niggas be at when they say they doin' all this and all that?</p>
  <br>
  <p>  Tired of beefin' you bums, you can't even pay me enough to react</p>
  <p>  Been wakin' up in the crib and sometimes I don't even know where I'm at</p>
  <p>  Please don't play that nigga songs in this party, I can't even listen to that</p>
  <p>  Anytime that I ran into somebody, it must be a victory lap, ayy</p>
  <p>  Shawty, come sit on my lap, ayy, they sayin' Drizzy just snap</p>
  <p>  Distance between us is not like a store, this isn't a closeable gap, ayy</p>
  <p>  I've seen some niggas attack and don't end up makin' it back</p>
  <br>
  <p>  I know that they at the crib goin' crazy, down bad</p>
  <p>  What they had didn't last, damn, baby</p>
  <br>
  <p>  Sometimes we laugh and sometimes we cry, but I guess you know now, baby</p>
  <p>  I took a half and she took the whole thing, slow down, baby (baby)</p>
  <p>  We took a trip, now we on your block and it's like a ghost town, baby</p>
  <p>  Where do these niggas be at when they say they doin' all this and all that?</p>
  <br>
  <p>  I'm in the trenches, relax</p>
  <p>  Can you not play that lil' boy in the club?</p>
  <p>  'Cause we do not listen to rats</p>
  <p>  We in Atlanta, I buy her a wig, she tellin' me "Tae is the best"</p>
  <p>  Point at the nigga who act like a killer, but you only one from the 'net</p>
  <p>  I'm like DaBaby, I'm not just a rapper, you play with me, you gon' get stretched</p>
  <p>  Hmm-hmm, Ooh-oh</p>
  <p>  Bring Drake to the hood, surround Drake around Dracs</p>
  <p>  Even though I got a case, I'ma do what it take</p>
  <p>  And I never been embraced</p>
  <p>  And the money's hard to make</p>
  <p>  So I bet they on they face right now</p>
  <br>
  <p>  I know that they at the crib goin' crazy, down bad</p>
  <p>  What they had didn't last, damn, baby</p>
  <br>
  <p>  Sometimes we laugh and sometimes we cry, but I guess you know now, baby</p>
  <p>  I took a half and she took the whole thing, slow down, baby (baby)</p>
    <p>We took a trip, now we on your block and it's like a ghost town, baby</p>
  <p>  Where do these niggas be at when they say they doin' all this and all that?</p>
  <br>
  <p>  When he tell the story, that's not how it went</p>
<p>    Know they be lyin', a hundred percent</p>
  <p>  Moved out the Ritz and forgot 'bout the Bent'</p>
<p>    Valet just called me to tell me come get it</p>
<p>    Knocked that boy off and I don't want no credit</p>
  <p>  If it was me, they wouldn't regret it</p>
  <p>  Left me for dead and now they wan' dead it, yeah</p>
  <p>  Heart is still beatin', my niggas still eatin'</p>
  <p>  Backyard, it look like the Garden of Eden</p>
  <p>  Pillow talk with 'em, she spillin' the tea</p>
  <p>  And then shawty came back and said she didn't mean it</p>
  <p>  It's hard to believe it</p>
  <br>
  <p>  I know that they at the crib goin' crazy, down bad</p>
  <p>  What they had didn't last, damn, baby</p>
  <br>
  <p>  Sometimes we laugh and sometimes we cry, but I guess you know now, baby</p>
  <p>  I took a half and she took the whole thing, slow down, baby (baby)</p>
  <p>  We took a trip, now we on your block and it's like a ghost town, baby</p>
  <p>  Where do these niggas be at when they say they doin' all this and all that?</p>
